testfactory
===========

A class factory for testing methods

This is an example of a C++ class factory used for studying sorting algorithms.

The first two objects are for system tests.  They are used to check the test
to make sure that it passes or fails as expected.

Additional objects are added to study sorting algorithms.  The sorted results
are checked against stl::sort for accuracy.
